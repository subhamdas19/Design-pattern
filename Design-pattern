singleton(javatpoint),synchronization(later),factory(javatpoint) and abstract factory (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-factory-pattern/)
diffrence between abstract factory and factory pattern
1.abstract factory has one more level of abstraction on top of it.Factory method uses inheritance and subclasses decide which class to instantiate
2.abstract factory uses an object which consists of multiple factory methods whereas factory pattern uses a single object
